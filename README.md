## Student Grade
    The first solution is the student grade solution. We want the user to get a response whenever they choose a student's marks and click enter.
    The marks ranges from 0 - 100 in the following grading order:
    < 40 : E
    40 - 49 : D
    49 - 59 : C
    60 - 79 : B
    /> 79 : A

### Instructions
    We needed to create a user input in the html file that would allow the user to choose a number between 0 and 100 inclusive. We had to create a submit button. 
    We needed to get the user value in order to ellicit the right response, that is the correct grade.
    We assigned the the input and the button unique id's.
    Since we wanted to ellicit a response based on the user's input, we had get the input element by id.
    We formed an anonymous function and assigned a variable 'myMarks' to the getElementById of the user's input value.
    Based on the value the user chooses, they would get the correct grade.
